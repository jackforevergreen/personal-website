        Quantifying the Climatic Impact of Anthropogenic Actions and the
        Imperative for Carbon Pricing Mechanisms
      </h1>
      <h2 style={styles.sectionTitle}>Executive Summary</h2>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        This report aims to introduce an approach to tackling the complex issue
        of climate change and global temperature rise. It provides evidence that
        anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from industry are leading to
        increased temperatures and climate change. Although the evidence is
        clear there is still a lack of progress being made in carbon abatement
        solutions. This report outlines the economic theory and history of
        pricing in negative externalities such as pollution and explores the
        past and current policy that has been implemented. There has been
        evidence of carbon pricing mechanisms leading to a reduction in carbon
        emissions. A cap–and-trade model can allow policy makers to implement a
        “cap” or limit on the quantity of carbon emissions and allow firms to
        trade allowance permits to reach an optimal quantity and price on carbon
        allowances. This has been supported by economic theory and proven to
        lead to the most efficient allocation of permits and the highest level
        of emissions abatement. This report highlights the need to incorporate
        environmental impacts into all decision making and pleads for
        international regulators to implement some form of carbon pricing
        mechanism to ensure firms internalize their impacts on the environment.
        It is clear that all stakeholders are becoming increasingly concerned
        with the change in climate and the need to have transparent
        communication and effective pollution pricing mechanisms. As the field
        sustainability continues to rapidly expand we hopefully will see more
        implementation of policies and frameworks such as this as well as
        increased innovation.

      <h2 style={styles.sectionTitle}>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        In 1987, the United Nations Brundtland Commission defined sustainability
        as “meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
        future generations to meet their own needs.''1 This essentially means
        meeting our current needs without jeopardizing future generations
        ability to meet theirs. Unfortunately if we continue to exploit natural
        resources, the livelihoods of our current future generations may be
        comprimised. As the effects of climate change have reached the present
        day, many countries have begun to take action. The UN has been a key
        driver over the past few decades in building international collaboration
        and setting standards for other countries to strive towards. In 2015 the
        UN released its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and with it 17
        SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals). These goals shared a blueprint for
        peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the
        future.2 These range from hunger, clean water, inequality, poverty, and
        climate action. In our analysis of carbon emissions and climate change
        we will be focusing on goal #13 Climate Action. In order to reach the
        goals outlined in goal 13’s indicators, such as “Improve education,
        awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change
        mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning” we will need
        to develop a strong systems thinking approach. Systems thinking is a way
        of making sense of the complexity of the world by looking at it in terms
        of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into its
        parts.3 This can be a valuable tool when discussing complex climate
        topics, as there are many things at play when setting climate policy or
        developing protocols. As we transition to a low carbon economy there
        needs to be defined collaborations and partnerships to reach net zero
        targets, and systems thinking can be a holistic approach to improve
        value chains. When developing solutions to address problems as large as
        climate change it is necessary to use systems thinking to develop
        positive feedback looks in all parts of the system. This includes
        individuals, organizations, governments, countries, and international
        regimes. As carbon emissions and greenhouse gasses have been proven to
        directly impact global temperature rise, there have been many
        methodologies which we will explore. These include carbon footprinting,
        negative environmental externalities, carbon pricing mechanisms, and the
        social cost of carbon. These variables can allow us to measure the
        negative environmental impacts of the system. Once measured and
        quantified, this will allow businesses and individuals to evaluate their
        decision making with this question in mind, “what is the environmental
        cost of this action?”. Hopefully, this will lead to a decrease in
        human-related activities that cause environmental harm and more
        organizations working towards protecting our planet.

      <h2 style={styles.sectionTitle}>2. The Problem</h2>
      <h3 style={styles.subSectionTitle}>
        2.1 Global temperature rise is causing our climate to change
      </h3>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        In 2023 there were 28 extreme weather events, costing the US over 92.8
        billion dollars. These weather events destroyed homes and cities, and
        killed 492 innocent citizens—the 8th most disaster-related fatalities
        for the contiguous U.S. since 1980.4 Global temperatures have risen 1.1
        degrees celsius from 1901-2020. This has already impacted our planet and
        led to record-breaking 4 heat waves on land and in the ocean, drenching
        rains, severe floods, multiyear-long droughts, extreme wildfires, and
        widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and
        more intense events.5 This is mostly due to the industrial revolution
        and increased burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural
        practices. Greenhouse gasses trap energy from the sun in the earth's
        atmosphere causing an increase in global temperatures. This relationship
        is commonly known as the “greenhouse effect”. Similar to how a
        greenhouse traps heat for plants to grow, the greenhouse gasses in the
        earth atmosphere heat up our planet. The first documented evidence was
        found in 1938 when a steam engineer named Guy Stewart Callendar decided
        to take a break from his day job and began painstakingly collecting
        records from 147 weather stations across the world. Doing all his
        calculations by hand, he discovered that global temperatures had risen
        0.3°C over the previous 50 years.6 Just two decades later in 1958 Dr.
        Keeling began taking measurements of C02, which led to a major discovery
        in the 20th century, the Keeling Curve. This shows the monthly average
        CO2 concentration in ppm.
      </p>

      <h3 style={styles.subSectionTitle}>2.2 Impact of Global temperature</h3>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The impacts of this rise in CO2 concentration have been serious. Climate
        change has impacted the health and well-being of billions of people
        worldwide. The increased concentration has also led to major
        environmental impacts that have led to melting ice caps, biodiversity
        loss, extreme weather events, ocean acidification, and major ecosystem
        disruptions. Human intervention has led to a disruption in the carbon
        cycle, which is responsible for balancing our global climate and
        ecosystem. The carbon cycle is the process that moves carbon between
        plants, animals, and microbes; minerals in the earth; and the
        atmosphere.7 Figure 2.2 shows all the carbon sources and 5 “carbon
        sinks” which sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Another key element
        of the diagram is “anthropogenic carbon” which is a carbon source that
        is directly from human activity.
      </p>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose from 275
        parts per million (ppm) in 1750 to 415 ppm globally now.8 A major
        contributor to the drastic increase has been the burning of fossil
        fuels, where global carbon emissions have significantly increased since
        1900. Since 1970, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90%, with
        emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes
        contributing about 78% of the total greenhouse gas emissions increase
        from 1970 to 2011.9 Globally over 4/5 of all energy produced is made up
        of coal, oil, or natural gas, all fossil fuels dense with greenhouse
        gasses. This energy is vital to power our utilities, fuel our vehicles,
        and provide electricity. Without fossil fuels many of our supply chains
        and manufacturing processes would not have sufficient power to operate.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.sectionTitle}>
        3. Past and current attempts to mitigate or solve the problem
      </h2>
      <h3 style={styles.subSectionTitle}>3.1 Economic Theory</h3>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        Establishing incentives and economic drivers to reduce negative
        environmental impacts from market activities has been studied for over a
        century. The concept of an “externality” was first coined by the British
        economist Alfred Marshall in work, "Principles of Economics," published
        in 1890. The externality represents an impact external to a market
        transaction where there are “external” effects. There are 3 main choices
        of the key policy instruments that have been developed for the control
        of externalities: taxes, subsidies and marketable permits. The Tax was
        first developed by another British economist Alftred Pigou in the 1920s.
        The Pigouvian approach was a way to internalize these external effects.
        The Pigovian tax, a tax equal to the negative externality so the costs
        are balanced. This was one of the first times negative environmental
        impacts have been flagged by economists and policy makers. From an
        economic point of view the issue is clear, in a competitive market,
        firms with free access to environmental resources will continue to
        engage in polluting activities until the marginal return of their
        production is 7 zero.10 Because historically there was no cost
        associated with pollution, these firms would continue to produce until
        other costs reduced their margin return for production. An effective
        policy would generate a price equivalent to the cost of pollution and
        force firms to internalize these social/external costs.
      </p>

      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        In the 1960s Robert Coase developed his theory of Coasian Trading and
        social costs. This removes transaction costs and if two parties trade
        based on their own incurred externalities, they would eventually reach
        the “Pareto Efficient” outcome. A common example being property rights,
        as the two parties would be able to reach an optimal price without
        government intervention. While this is an interesting theory it is hard
        to put into practice in the complex system of businesses and our natural
        environment. A pair of Canadian and American economists, John Dales and
        Tommy Crocker expanded on this idea of diluting trading costs with their
        method to control pollution in the form of permit markets. A permit is
        an allowance for emissions and firms would be able to trade permits at
        their leisure. Through further analysis and models it was revealed that
        this would lead to lower emissions reductions cost and provide forward
        thinking firms a reward for reducing past the standards, as other high
        emitting firms would have to purchase permits from them.
      </p>
      <h3 style={styles.subSectionTitle}>3.2 Policy</h3>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        The 1970s spurred by the Earth Day movement was a great decade for
        climate action. Much of the basic policy needed to protect our
        environment was enacted, such as creation of the National Environmental
        Policy Act (NEPA), Endangered Species Act, Natural Forest Management
        Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the creation of the EPA. Most
        impactful was the Clean Air Act, which resulted in a major shift in the
        federal government's role in air pollution control. This legislation
        authorized the development of comprehensive federal and state
        regulations to limit emissions from both stationary (industrial) sources
        and mobile sources.11 Later in 1990 this was amended in “Title V” of the
        1990 federal Clean Air Act Amendments by the Environmental Protection
        Agency (EPA) to establish a national, operating permit program. This was
        one of the first uses of permit markets as these market structures were
        getting a lot of attention due to one major advantage, the marketable
        permit approach gives the environmental authority direct control over
        the quantity of emissions.10 As permit trading mechanisms proved their
        effectiveness, frameworks in the UN began to develop. The most
        groundbreaking was the Kyoto Protocol, which sets binding emission
        reduction targets for 37 industrialized countries and economies in
        transition and the European Union. Overall, these targets add up to an
        average 5 per cent emission reduction compared to 1990 levels over the
        five year period 2008–2012 (the first commitment period).12 This was the
        first international emissions trading system, and remains revolutionary
        to this day, as very few international markets exist. Over the following
        two decades smaller emissions trading schemes popped up across the
        globe. Their true effectiveness has yet to be fully revealed due to lack
        of adoption in major emitting countries such as the US.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.sectionTitle}>4. Analysis of current situation</h2>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        Although the daunting number of anthropogenic carbon emissions continues
        to rise, with it are those determined to decrease our reliance on fossil
        fuels and high emitting behaviors. Most notably in 2015 the UN released
        the Paris Agreement, which was adopted by 196 parties and is a strict 5
        year cycled plan to reduce global temperature rise to 1.5°C above
        pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce
        the risks and impacts of climate change. Additionally just this March
        the SEC issued a final rule that requires registrants to provide
        comprehensive climate disclosures in their annual reports and
        registration statements. These requirements significantly expand
        climate-related disclosures and the need for developed reporting
        capabilities. As shareholders have access to published records of
        companies environmental impacts they can demand lower emissions as this
        can have serious business risks as well. With all of these disclosure
        requirements and targets, there is an increasing need for quality market
        mechanisms and policy adjustments to funnel climate related funds to
        positive projects. The concept of “carbon pricing” has continued to gain
        popularity as an attractive approach. Carbon pricing works by capturing
        the external costs of emitting carbon - i.e. the costs that the public
        pays, such as loss of property due to rising sea levels, the damage to
        crops caused by changing rainfall patterns, or the health care costs
        associated with heat waves and droughts - and placing that cost back at
        its source.13 This can have many benefits including further 9 investment
        and innovations with generated revenues from carbon policy. The two main
        market mechanisms are a carbon tax and carbon cap-and-trade. The goal of
        carbon taxes or any carbon pricing mechanism is to cost effectively
        reduce emissions and drive innovation from businesses and consumers to
        change behavior to avoid the new imposed costs of their environmental
        impacts. Additionally another advantage of carbon taxes is that they can
        generate new revenues that can be used towards green projects. A 2017
        study estimates a tax of $49 per metric ton of carbon dioxide could
        raise about $2.2 trillion in net revenues over 10 years from 2019 to
        2028. 14 A tax on emissions in Great Britain, introduced in 2013, has
        led to the proportion of electricity generated from coal falling from
        40% to 3% over six years, according to research led by UCL.15 While the
        carbon tax is an attractive option for policy makers to implement, it
        can be hard to determine what level to tax at, as many models derive
        vastly different numbers. The alternative policy instrument is the
        carbon cap-and-trade model, which aims to set a “cap” or limit on the
        total number of emissions and allocate allowance credits that companies
        can trade amongst themselves. This allows the policymaker to set climate
        targets and companies to have agency to trade and emit at a level that
        makes sense for them. In California for example, The Air Resource Board
        set their cap to deliver an overall 15% reduction in greenhouse gas
        emissions and set a statewide limit on sources responsible for 85
        percent of California’s GHG emissions.16 There are two ways permits can
        be allocated once the cap has been set, either for free or through an
        auction. The advantage of auctioning allowances—rather than giving them
        away for free—is that resulting revenues can be used to reduce other
        taxes that act as a drag on income or investment. This can be the most
        efficient option as it minimizes net cost to the economy. There are two
        types of carbon cap-and-trade markets. First is the regulatory or
        compliance market. These are established by governments or multilateral
        regimes. The other type of market is the voluntary carbon market (VCM).
        The VCM allows companies, non-profit organizations, governments, and
        individuals to buy and sell carbon offset credits. The EU ETS is one of
        the largest multinational carbon markets today. It was established in
        2005 and covers over 45% of the EU's carbon emissions.17 Currently, the
        EU is in Phase 4 of trading where the overall number of emission
        allowances will decrease at an annual rate of 2.2% from 2021 onwards,
        compared to 1.74% in the period 2013-2020. The reduction rate is in line
        with the 2030 target of at least 40% cuts in EU greenhouse gas
        emissions.18 The expected growth of carbon markets over the next decade
        is massive. As more and more industries are subject to its regulation,
        there is an expected domino effect. As one industry is forced to comply,
        it will push its peers and competitors to face the same rules.
        Additionally with the new border regulations such as Carbon Border
        Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) many countries will opt for manufacturers to
        pay domestic fees as opposed to international tariffs. The VCM is also
        expected to have huge growth over the next few decades. Boston
        Consulting Group projects the market to reach between $10 billion and
        $40 billion, while McKinsey projects $50 billion in 2030, and Morgan
        Stanley even estimates up to about $100 billion in 2030 and around $250
        billion by 2050.19,20,21 The voluntary carbon market can support a wider
        range of projects that can benefit local communities as well. These
        projects can include renewable energy, industrial gas capture, energy
        efficiency, forestry initiatives 10 (avoiding deforestation), clean
        water, regenerative agriculture, wind power, biogas, oil recycling,
        solar power, water filters, ocean cleanup, and many more. As the
        international global targets set by the UN and other major international
        alliances, we can expect more growth and participation. Today, almost a
        quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions (23%) are now covered by 73
        instruments.22 If we continue on this trend soon all emissions will be
        accounted for and companies and industries will be held liable for their
        impact on the environment.
      </p>

      <h2 style={styles.sectionTitle}>5. Proposal</h2>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        As we continue to uncover the anthropogenic impacts of humans it is
        important to recognize our damages and take action. We must understand
        that our GHG emissions are having drastic effects on our environment and
        societies. It is important to understand, calculate, measure, and reduce
        these impacts to the best of our ability and extend our time horizon
        beyond next quarters earnings. This can be done with the social cost of
        carbon, which measures damages associated with a project including
        changes in net agricultural productivity, human health, property damages
        from increased flood risk, and changes in energy system costs, such as
        reduced costs for heating and increased costs for air conditioning.23 We
        must understand the full impacts of our decision making as it relates to
        all aspects of our environment, social, and economic systems. Currently
        most people make simple economic decisions, but as we begin to realize
        the importance of sustainability, hopefully everyone will consider
        environmental and social damages prior to a project. In the future as we
        see more mature frameworks and advanced methodologies for understanding
        these impacts, we should also see higher transparency and communication
        to all stakeholders. For example, a company or entity that is currently
        emitting a large amount of CO2 reports on their emissions, and regularly
        updates its stakeholders on the work that it is doing to reduce them. It
        is important to note that we are all on the same team in regards to
        climate action. In addition this should be communicated to consumers as
        well. Market demand is driven by consumers and it can be a powerful
        economic driver. Climate impacts should not be hidden from consumers, it
        should be prominently displayed on all packaging, “this product emits X
        tons of CO2” and consumers can make the choice for themselves if that is
        something they want to purchase. Just as price can be a deterrent, so
        should environmental impacts. Beyond just communication there needs to
        be stronger systems in place for policy. There are some quality
        international policy agreements such the Paris Agreement and others, but
        there needs to be more cooperation between countries. It should be clear
        that there is a necessity for some form of carbon pricing or policy, and
        world leaders should step up and develop this as there are financial
        incentives. We need to address our global political systems as well as
        they are not built to make the best decision rather what suits them the
        best. Carbon pricing mechanisms such as a cap-and-trade can create new
        revenues and positive feedback loops for businesses and governments to
        continue to participate. A market based approach also has advantages as
        it allows the agency of participants to make decisions for themselves
        and a true price to be revealed. Unfortunately I do not see this policy
        or marketplace being built in the near future, hence why the VCM has
        some appeal. We see businesses and individuals voluntarily reducing
        emissions 11 faster than policy can be built to address it. The
        projected growth in the VCM is exponential and will reach hundreds of
        billions of dollars in the next three decades from a valuation of two
        billion in 2023. With this also comes a need for education. Educating
        all parties about what is the right thing to do? What emits the most
        carbon? How can I change my behavior to be more aware of my
        environmental impact? These questions should not be complex to answer,
        but they are. We need to fully understand what is causing our negative
        environmental impacts, and what we can do to mitigate our damages. This
        comes with a deep analysis of sustainability and its complex systems. It
        is clear that even over the last half a century sustainability has
        advanced at a rapid rate, we have developed technologies that nobody
        thought were possible, until they were developed. This requires more
        minds working on our more complex and impending problem yet, climate
        change. With an increased effort we will see new innovations and
        transformations in the space, and hopefully reductions in our negative
        environmental impacts.

      <h2 style={styles.sectionTitle}>6. Conclusions</h2>
      <p style={styles.paragraph}>
        In conclusion there are a few points to highlight.
      </p>
      <ul style={styles.list}>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          United Nations Brundtland Commission defined sustainability as

        </li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          When developing solutions to address problems as large as climate

          Global temperatures have risen 1.1 degrees celsius from 1901-2020.
          This has already impacted our planet and led to record-breaking heat
          waves on land and in the ocean, drenching rains, severe floods,
          multiyear-long droughts, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding
          during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense
          events.

          Since 1970, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90%, with emissions
          from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributing
          about 78% of the total greenhouse gas emissions increase from 1970 to
          2011.

          There are 3 main choices of the key policy instruments that have been
          developed for the control of externalities: taxes, subsidies and
          marketable permits.
        </li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          Carbon pricing works by capturing the external costs of emitting
          carbon - i.e. the costs that the public pays, such as loss of property
          due to rising sea levels, the damage to crops caused by changing
          rainfall patterns, or the health care costs associated with heat waves
          and droughts - and placing that cost back at its source.{" "}
        </li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          The alternative policy instrument is the carbon cap-and-trade model,
          which aims to set a “cap” or limit on the total number of emissions
          and allocate allowance credits that companies can trade amongst
          themselves. This allows the policymaker to set climate targets and
          companies to have agency to trade and emit at a level that makes sense
          for them.{" "}
        </li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          We must understand the full impacts of our decision making as it
          relates to all aspects of our environment, social, and economic
          systems.
        </li>

        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          A market based approach also has advantages as it allows the agency of
          participants to make decisions for themselves and a true price to be
          revealed.
        </li>
        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          We see businesses and individuals voluntarily reducing emissions
          faster than policy can be built to address it.
        </li>

        <li style={styles.listItem}>
          With an increased effort we will see new innovations and
          transformations in the space, and hopefully reductions in our negative
          environmental impacts.
